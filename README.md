# Assignmen-3-SpeedReading-APP
<h1> 
Project Description</h1>

<p>

The purpose of this web application was based on the 5x5 Speed reading game for children, game used to improve their speed in reading. The application was supposed to be able to make thing easier for both children and teachers. The user can have roles, "Admin" for teachers and "Student" for children. The Admin user should be able to create new texts to be read and see the results of all the students. The children should be able to choose a text to read or have a random text to read in an interval of 5 minutes, by having a timer that once goes off redirect to the counting page. On the counting page, the student is supposed to drag and drop the read text and have it counted automatically. The counted data should come as total amount of words read in 5 min but also as word/minute(in words/minute the function would calculate the total amount of words divided by 5 and in case of a smaller number than 5 it would not make the divide calculus and put the no. of words). The main purpose of the web is to make the reading exercise more accurate and easy both for teachers and students.
